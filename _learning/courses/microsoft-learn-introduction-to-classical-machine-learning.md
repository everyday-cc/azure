title: "Build classical machine learning models with supervised learning"
excerpt: "Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where an algorithm learns from examples of data. We progressively paint a picture of how supervised learning automatically generates a model that can make predictions about the real world. We also touch on how these models are tested, and difficulties that can arise when training them."
