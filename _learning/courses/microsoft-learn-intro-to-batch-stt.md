Batch Transcriptionâ€™s high throughput makes it ideal for call centers that have to transcribe hundreds or thousands of calls every day to ensure they meet regulations and compliance standards. Batch Transcription also enables better data analyses, which can let call centers ensure that customer feedback is taken into account, staff are treated fairly, and to ensure problems are dealt with quickly and properly."
